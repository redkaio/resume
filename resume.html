<h1><em>This is my first Header. It comes on the top of the page</em></h1>
<h2>The second header comes right below the first one, but less highlighted</h2>

<p>So, right now, I have learned the difference between 'em' and 'i', also between 'b' and 'strong'.</p>
<p>Also, I learned the difference between 'ul' and 'ol'. 'ul' uses bullet points and 'ol' use numbers. This is very important.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Learn</li>
    <li>Live</li>
    <li>Conquer</li>
</ul>
<ol>
    <li>Wake Up</li>
    <li>Be the King</li>
    <li>Survive</li>
    <li>Go back to bed</li>
</ol>

<p>GitHub, you will not win.</p>
<p>Há! I told you!</ps>
<p>So, keeping the studies up to date, this is how we can add links on words using HTML. And why not test it using GitHub as a sample? This is my <a href="https://github.com/redkaio/resume" target="_blank">GitHub Page</a>, where I will post my progresses.</p>

<p>This is an <a href="mailto:chrno.92@gmail.com" target="_blank">Email</a> test. And it seems to work just fine!</p>

<p>So, there is two kinds of breaking row: br and hr</p>
<hr>
This was a 'hr' test.

<p>So we can make an <a href="resume2.html" target="_blank">external link</a> using a local file</p>
