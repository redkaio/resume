<p>So, right now, I have learned the difference between 'em' and 'i', also between 'b' and 'strong'.</p>
<p>Also, I learned the difference between 'ul' and 'ol'. 'ul' uses bullet points and 'ol' use numbers. This is very important.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Learn</li>
    <li>Live</li>
    <li>Conquer</li>
</ul>
<ol>
    <li>Wake Up</li>
    <li>Be the King</li>
    <li>Survive</li>
    <li>Go back to bed</li>
</ol>
